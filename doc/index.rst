*Pycsou-gsp* is the graph signal processing extension of the Python 3 package `Pycsou <https://github.com/matthieumeo/pycsou>`_ for solving linear inverse problems. The extension offers implementations of graph *convolution* and *differential* operators, compatible with Pycsou's interface for linear operators. Such tools can be useful when solving linear inverse problems involving signals defined on non Euclidean discrete manifolds.

Graphs in *Pycsou-gsp* are instances from the class ``pygsp.graphs.Graph`` from the `pygsp <https://github.com/epfl-lts2/pygsp>`_ library for graph signal processing with Python. 

Content
-------

The package is organised as follows:

1. The subpackage ``pycgsp.linop`` implements the following common graph linear operators:
  
   * Graph convolution operators: :py:class:`~pycgsp.linop.conv.GraphConvolution`
   * Graph differential operators: :py:class:`~pycgsp.linop.diff.GraphLaplacian`, :py:class:`~pycgsp.linop.diff.GraphGradient`, :py:class:`~pycgsp.linop.diff.GeneralisedGraphLaplacian`.

2. The subpackage ``pycgsp.graph`` provides routines for generating graphs from discrete tessellations of continuous manifolds such as the sphere.
